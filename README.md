# Django101 Task Tracker 📝

A simple task management app built during my learning journey with **Django 101**.

This project helped me understand the basics of:
- Setting up a Django project and app
- Using views, URLs, and templates
- Working with in-memory data structures (lists/dictionaries)
- Implementing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Integrating Bootstrap for basic UI styling

## Features

✅ View all tasks  
✅ Create a new task  
✅ View task details  
✅ Delete a task  
✅ Bootstrap-powered layout

## How to Run It Locally

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/django101-task-tracker.git
   cd django101-task-tracker
   
2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   env\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install Django:**
   ```bash
   pip install django
   ```
4. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
5. **Open in browser:**
   Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/

Notes
This app stores tasks in-memory using Python lists, so all tasks will reset when the server restarts. It's intentionally simple to focus on Django fundamentals.
